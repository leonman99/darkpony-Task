Instruction on how to run.

1) Download the project from Git.

2) Install FastAPI and uvicorn to work as the server.
(link with more clear instructions: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/)

3) Start the server by using the command: uvicorn main:app --reload
(main.py is the python file that responds to the api calls)

4) Check if the server is running by visiting the address http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
with the browser. Through this address, someone could see the whole structure of the API.
But, I recommend opening the main.py file for a more precise look.

5) All thats left now, is to open the file index-final.html in your browser to visit the
webpage.
(the first time, internet connection is required, in order for the page to connect with
the bootstrap server to download all the needed html,css,js etc)

6) Enjoy!
